          Magic has been passed down throughout the ages. It used to be taught
          somewhat more openly, and accepted on some level. The rise secular
          conservatism saw magic not as a threat, but as a living manifestion of
          sainthood. Many magicians themselves agreed, and turned to religion to
          answer why they were given power.

        <UserQuote paragraph>
          The problem became when animals revealed themselves as magicians as
          well. The first were snakes. Christians saw this as a direct
          correlation to the Garden of Eden. They were terrified. They believed
          these animals were not saints, but demons, regardless of what forms
          they appeared in afterwards.

          Today, magic is only taught to a handful of people and creatures,

          including science, computing, mathematics, humanities, history,
