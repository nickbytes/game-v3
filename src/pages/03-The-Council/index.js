        <h1>The Council</h1>
        <p>
          _George_ moves out from behind the booth and leads you along a small
          gently winding stone-lined path. As you get closer to the huts, you
          see their brilliance. They are completely smooth, as if cut from
          lasers, as if they were always that shape. They look quite solid and
          dense, though you cannot see through the deep darkness and small
          doorways that would accommodate only a creature of _George's_ size.
        </p>

        <p>
          You count the buildings. 8, 10, 12. 13. One building, is much larger
          than the other. You can see it along the path, towards the back of the
          grouping of huts. It has a large entrance, large enough for you to
          walk through.
        </p>

        <p>
          You suddenly realize _George_ has been talking the entire time you've
          been trying to take the scene in. Everything feels like a blur.
        </p>

        GEORGE IS TALKING.
        YOU ARE IN SOME OTHER PLACE.
        IS THIS A DREAM.
        WHY THE HELL AM I STILL HOLDING THIS TOASTER

        <p>
          You heart pounds. You hear George say something about "last time" and
          "of course its all dangerous but it's the only option" but you can
          barely hear George over your heart pounding.
        </p>

        <p>
          George stops at the doorway, a bone white door, nearly flush with the
          outside of the building and turns back to you. George is trying to
          hold back tears as one escapes. "So young, too young, I shouldn't say
          anymore, but I'm worried for..." George takes a deep breath and tries
          to stay composed.
        </p>

        <p>"I'm not young... I don't understand"</p>

        <p>George isn't paying attention, engulfed in tears.</p>

        <p>
          "Go on, they're waiting for you. I'll be out here once you're
          finished. You can leave your bags, but take the [item]."
        </p>

        <p>
          You push the door, which though thick, is incredibly light. You're
          first draw to the hanging light at the top of the cone roof. A circle
          _orb_ glowly softly, andâ€“
        </p>

        <p>
          "Ahhhhh, _Nickbytes_, Software Engineer @ Postlight, Earthling of the
          Twitter tribe."
        </p>

        <p>
          You see the circlular table, surrounded by a group of _Birds_ dressed
          similarly, though more intricate and grandoise, as George.
        </p>

        <p>What a strange title.</p>

        <p>"We, as you might know, are The Council."</p>

        - React angrily no!
        - What the fuck is going on?
        - Nod
        - We bring you here

        <p>
          "Comrade Igglefort, may we get back to the matter at hand" another
          _bird_ says.
        </p>

        <p>"The Council has decided. There will be no further discussions-"</p>
