            {this.props.petNameInputSaved || "Sam"} moves out from behind the
            booth and leads you along a small gently winding stone-lined path.
            As you get closer to the huts, you see their brilliance. They are
            completely smooth, as if cut from lasers, as if they were always
            that shape. They look quite solid and dense, though you cannot see
            through the deep darkness and small doorways that would accommodate
            only a creature of {this.props.petNameInputSaved || "Sam"}'s size.

            You count the buildings. 8, 10, 12. 13. One building, is much larger
            than the other. You can see it along the path, towards the back of
            the grouping of huts. It has a large entrance, large enough for you
            to walk through...

            You have been selected for a task. But first, some background. Magic
            has been passed down throughout the ages. It used to be taught
            somewhat more openly, and accepted on some level, but rises in
            secular conservatism saw it as a threat. People persecuted magicial
            beings. Now it is hushed, but helps to keep societal balance in some
            ways. Today, magic is only taught to a handful of people, usually
            found in their early teens. These teenagers possess abilities in
            science, computing, mathematics. The best magicians are critical
            thinkers, optimists. A few will go into politics, but that can
            really go awry.

            Ivy League colleges were created to find best and brightest, and
            pump logical, big biz, into their veins, to stamp magic out. It's
            own optimistic ritual, though dangerous. The same faith in trickle
            down morality as in economics. She is a number of a handful. She has
            been learning. It is time for her to learn more, to assert more
            influence.

            Why politicians not seek to out magic? Would cause panic. Some of
            them are covert magicians themselves.

            Next bit of her training is the most important, need an easy vessel
            for communication. Your keyboard. Once items made magical, hard to
            detect obviously, looks as though a product of modern tech. Last
            time tried a blender, obvious fluke...
