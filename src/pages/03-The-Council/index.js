            _George_ moves out from behind the booth and leads you along a
            small
            gently winding stone-lined path. As you get closer to the huts, you
            see their brilliance. They are completely smooth, as if cut from
            lasers, as if they were always that shape. They look quite solid and
            dense, though you cannot see through the deep darkness and small
            doorways that would accommodate only a creature of _George's_ size.

            You count the buildings. 8, 10, 12. 13. One building, is much larger
            than the other. You can see it along the path, towards the back of
            the
            grouping of huts. It has a large entrance, large enough for you to
            walk through.

            You suddenly realize _George_ has been talking the entire time
            you've
            been trying to take the scene in. Everything feels like a blur.

            You heart pounds. You hear George say something about "last time"
            and
            "of course its all dangerous but it's the only option" but you can
            barely hear George over your heart pounding.

            George stops at the doorway, a bone white door, nearly flush
            with the
            outside of the building and turns back to you. George is trying to
            hold back tears as one escapes. "So young, too young, I shouldn't
            say
            anymore, but I'm worried for..." George takes a deep breath and
            tries
            to stay composed.
