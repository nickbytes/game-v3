        {props.petNameInputSaved} moves out from behind the booth and leads you
        along a narrow gently winding, stone-lined path. As you get closer to
        the huts, you see their brilliance. They are completely smooth, with no
        imperfections, as if they were always that shape. They look quite solid
        and dense, though you cannot see through the deep darkness and small
        doorways that would accommodate only a creature of{" "}
