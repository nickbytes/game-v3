            {this.props.petNameInputSaved || "Sam"} moves out from behind the
            booth and leads you along a narrow gently winding, stone-lined path.
            As you get closer to the huts, you see their brilliance. They are
            completely smooth, with no imperfections, as if they were always
            that shape. They look quite solid and dense, though you cannot see
            through the deep darkness and small doorways that would accommodate
            only a creature of {this.props.petNameInputSaved || "Sam"}'s size.

              Magic has been passed down throughout the ages. It used to be
              taught somewhat more openly, and accepted on some level, but rises
              in secular conservatism saw it as a threat. People persecuted
              magicial beings. Now it is hushed, but helps to keep societal

              people, usually found in their early teens. These teenagers
              possess abilities in science, computing, mathematics. The best
