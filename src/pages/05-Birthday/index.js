        "Hey, ill take your stuff up to the guest room. You go relax and say
        hello to Emma and Jill."

        You walk into the kitchen, dodging teenagers scurrying about the house,
        past parents chatting.

        "_Nick_!" you're met with a hug.

        "_Jill_, thanks so much for having me"

        "Of course. We're all glad to see you, _Alex_ tells me you're spending
        far too much time at the office. _Emma_ missed you. She's in the
        backyard with her friends."

        Grab a can of fizzoda.
        - Keep your mind right
        Grab a can of Burrrrrr Beer.
        - Need this shit right about now.

        You walk out the back door. _Emma_ and her group of friends are doing
        group _Slipknot karaoke_. It's adorable and hardcore as fuck. She's
        learned so well.

        "_Comrade Nick_!"

        She runs over and gives you a hug. At that exact moment The Council's
        words bounce through your head. Why must such great risk be put on such
        a young girl? Such a burden. What will this task do to her childhood...?

        ...

        should you take on whatever the task is...?

        :: footsteps ::

        You slide away from the parents and children, and make your way
        upstairs. At the end of the hallway, you see _Emma's_ room, mostly
        because of the _Wow_ posters on the door.

        You open the door quietly, and quickly close it behind you.

        Your chest tightens, fingers begin to shake and fidget. How can you just
        leave the _item_ here? Will she know what to do with it? Does she
        understand the risks she is facing?

        Your thoughts swim within a pool of possible morbid outcomes.

        :: animation of skull ::

        "_Uncle Nick_, what are you doing in here?"

        - Fulfill your role
        - You set down the item.

        _Iwasjustdroppingoffthegiftidon'tknowwhatisgoingon_

        - it's okay Uncle Nick.
        - it is? You attempt to hold back tears. but i dont understand why. I
        don't understand what is happening

        She guides you over towards the chair at her computer.

        -

        - Take on the task yourself
        - You put the item back into your bag.
        - Your pulse races as you look for an explanation of why you've snuck
        into her room.
        - "Just wanted to see if you still had my old computer with all those
        great games on it."
        - "Oh yea, it's over here." She points to the section of computers and
        hardware in the corner, then leads you over. "Still works like a charm,
        added a new graphics card a year ago"
        - You smile as she walks you through the changes she's made to the
        computer, and though you taught her some of the basics, her knowledge
        greatly surpassing yours at this point, and you feel proud.
        - "that's amazing, you've taken the shell of an entirely old PC and
        turned it into a powerful computing machine."
        - "thanks, theres only one piece left."
        - "whats that" you ask, as your palms becoming sweaty.
        - "oh _Uncle Nick_, i thought we'd passed this..."
        - you're confused. what does she know. how could she?
        - Dog passed info said you were taking it especially rough this time
        - How does she know
        - She reaches for you bag and removes it from your clutches.
        -
        <h1>Hello</h1>
      </div>
