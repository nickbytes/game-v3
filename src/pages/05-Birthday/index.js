            past parents chatting.

            You walk out the back door. _Emma_ and her group of friends are
            doing
            group _Slipknot karaoke_. It's adorable and hardcore as fuck. She's
            learned so well.

            She runs over and gives you a hug. At that exact moment The
            Council's
            words bounce through your head. Why must such great risk be put on
            such
            a young girl? Such a burden. What will this task do to her
            childhood...?

            You slide away from the parents and children, and make your way
            upstairs. At the end of the hallway, you see _Emma's_ room, mostly
            because of the _Wow_ posters on the door.

            Your chest tightens, fingers begin to shake and fidget. How can you
            just
            leave the _item_ here? Will she know what to do with it? Does she
            understand the risks she is facing?

            - Fulfill your role
            - You set down the item.

            _Iwasjustdroppingoffthegiftidon'tknowwhatisgoingon_

            - it's okay Uncle Nick.
            - it is? You attempt to hold back tears. but i dont understand why.
            I
            don't understand what is happening

            She guides you over towards the chair at her computer.

            - Take on the task yourself
            - You put the item back into your bag.
            - Your pulse races as you look for an explanation of why you've
            snuck
            into her room.
            - "Just wanted to see if you still had my old computer with all
            those
            great games on it."
            - "Oh yea, it's over here." She points to the section of computers
            and
            hardware in the corner, then leads you over. "Still works like a
            charm,
            added a new graphics card a year ago"
            - You smile as she walks you through the changes she's made to the
            computer, and though you taught her some of the basics, her
            knowledge
            greatly surpassing yours at this point, and you feel proud.
            - "that's amazing, you've taken the shell of an entirely old PC and
            turned it into a powerful computing machine."
            - "thanks, theres only one piece left."
            - "whats that" you ask, as your palms becoming sweaty.
            - "oh _Uncle Nick_, i thought we'd passed this..."
            - you're confused. what does she know. how could she?
            - Dog passed info said you were taking it especially rough this time
            - How does she know
            - She reaches for you bag and removes it from your clutches.
