        You sit down again in the same seat on the train.

        You watch outside, as _George_ waves to you. And you feel the familiar
        jolt of the train as it begins to move forward. After some time, the
        train gains speed and you can no longer seen the small village of
        Slashington, only the barren landscape. One hour passes. A small red,
        ice capped mountain appears in the distance. Closer and closer it comes
        over the next hour, and the train appears to be preparing to go through
        a tunnel at the base.

        You look back towards Slashington, though it is now disappeared in the
        distance. The sun is beginning to peak from the horizon to your left. As
        you enter the tunnel, darkness engulfs your car.

        Three or four seconds. Suddenly the car bursts with morning light, you
        grimace and squint in the stark contrast. When you open your eyes, the
        train car is again packed with people, regular people. People reading
        their tablets, morning papers, talking on cell phones, glancing out the
        window as you pass through Baltimore.

        Scene: Alex greets you at the station. You load your bags and [item ]
        into the trunk of his car.

        "What's with the [item]?" hes asks, somewhat concerned.

        "Oh. Something I was getting fixed. No big deal."

        He goes on chatting about work, neighbors, _____ 's job, only do you
        take notice when he mentions the exception grades Emma has been getting.

        "That's great, real great."

        The words of The Council echo in your head.

        > The burden is too great for one so young. Surely some adult can take
        on responsibility.

        > It must be her. We've gone over this. She is uniquely talented, and
        her path will cross appropriately.

        > But she may not be able to do it. She may die.

        > It is the only way..

        "Hey, anyway, we're glad to have you here. You look like you could use a
        little break from the office for a weekend."

        "Yeah, definitely."
