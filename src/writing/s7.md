Sketching ideas for ending scene

* looking up at leaves
* this has been a great weekend
* exactly what you needed
* some time away from the computer with family
* ahh and the birthday party
* so nice to see niece and friends
* she really loved the keyboard you gave her
* that was a great idea of yours, how did you come up with that
* intuition, you do sometimes feel like you know her best, yes that must be it
* and how the day has flown
* you barely even remember getting here, the train, the drive to the house seemed short, and where had the time gone, well you fell asleep out here, the exhaustion. Jesus, need to take a few more breaks from work this year, use those vacation days, come back down here maybe.
* "hey all good over there? Need a drink or anything?"
* your brother asks from the back door
* "sure yea anything"
* the leaves, really beautiful, the ones still left at least, gently flickering, holding on to the last bits of branch, like some memory, barely left in your mind, ready to be released.
* "here nick, what are you looking at?"
* "oh nothing just admiring the trees out here, watching the birds."
* "its nice right? Nice to get away from the city for a bit. I noticed you had a little nap out here, glad to see you're relaxing."

Another idea:

* just a phone call
* phone enters blank screen
* alex talking about how was great to see you that weekend, bummed you didnt get to chat more, but they enjoyed having you, niece loved the keyboard.
* you barely remember
* its monday morning, the alarm clock woke you up
* flashes of birthday party
