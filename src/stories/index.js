      Magic has been passed down throughout the ages. It used to be taught
      somewhat more openly, and accepted on some level, but rises in secular
      conservatism saw it as a threat.{" "}

      People persecuted magicial beings. Now it is hushed, but helps to keep
      societal balance in some ways.

    <UserQuote paragraph>
      Today, magic is only taught to a handful of people, usually found in their
      early teens, though in some cases, later. These teenagers possess
      abilities and interests a number of fields including science, computing,
      mathematics, humanities, history, languages â€“ you get the gist.

    <UserQuote paragraph>
      The best magicians are critical thinkers. A few will go into politics, but
      that can really go awry.
