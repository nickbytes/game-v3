They begin to explain in unison.

You catch bits from each of them, who seem to be volleying phrases back and forth with each other, creating an intricate narrative.

Parts of it even sound familiar, though you can't imagine how they would.

You hear some things you never thought you'd hear in the same sentences.

You catch that magic has existed for thousands of years.

A division and secret war amongst magicial animals and magical humans, further divisions and factions created amongst each of those groups.

Elaborate attempts at secrecy, inflitrations into religions and states, governing bodies created, and disbanded.

They stop for a moment, as if to assess if you are following along, before starting up again, speaking even faster.

Politicians, celebrities, popes, common folk, all types of magicians? All in hiding? You wonder how but don't have time to ask as they continue you on.

You hear about the change the internet brings, the ability to connect people yet also to silo. The ability to spread information at an unprecedented scale.

They mention {props.playerOccupationSaved}s be "extremely online" and good candidates, but you have no idea what that means.

They talk about teaching new humans and magical creatures their philosophies, centered around science, and exploration of their craft.

They describe successfull magicians: curious, empathetic, fierce, creative, hungry... and you can't help but feel like they're talking about you... you are standing here, in front of them.

They stop abruptly, as if an orchestra cut off by their maestro suddenly.

One of them grabs the keyboard and waves their fingers over the top of it.

When you imagined what magic would look like it was not this.

You imagined it so artistic, graceful, and nuanced. But here you are, watching <i>real magic</i>, and in the corniest way, this {props.petTypeInputSaved} waved 'spirit fingers' over the keyboard. You're almost disappointed, before you see the {props.petTypeInputSaved} push a key and you watch the keyboard light up.

It's as if the sun itself is hiding behind each of the keys. It's a bright light, imminating 3-4 inches between the cracks of each of the keys. The glow feels warm and in your mind you know that must be what magic feels like.

You love the feeling.

The next part of training is the most important, the first mission is dangerous, but we are nearly out of time.

What mission am I to do?

You ask almost brashly, but you can't help it, you are drunk with confidence (the magic?) from the keyboard. The feeling dies within seconds and you wondered why you even said anything.

You, {props.playerNameSaved}, are the messenger. You will deliver this your niece, Olive.

What?

The words spit themselves out.

Your niece will place a curse on Frailty Stow, once she has learned the appropriate magical methods.

Frailty Stow? The pop singer?

Country pop, really.

yes, the, er... country pop singer.

How? Is she going to be in danger? Why must it be her? She's only 15, well 16 tomororw.

You board the train again, with {props.petNameInputSaved} waving at you. As you look through the sliding doors, you hear The Council's words reverberate through your head.

It must be here. She is nearly halfway trained now.

Exceptional ability and upside.

Yes, they heard your pleas to help, to take the task yourself, but they would have nothing of it. You were just the messenger.

Yet they didnt seem to care much about the welfare of your niece. Not in your mind at least. Yes, they see <i>value</i> in her, but they do not <i>care</i> for her.

THe dangers, they told you, were great.

One of their less capable magicians had been caught, before even being able to carry out their plan. THey now relied on Olive.

What had happened to the other magician...? You had asked, but they would not speak of it, and when you thought you heard one of the {props.petTypeInputSaved} mumble something about permanent memory allicilatory obfunscator they didnt expect, you asked more, but they would not tell you.

You didnt want to admit it, but you feared the {props.petNameInputSaved} a little. If they were capable of gettin you to a ...

... well what is this place ...?

You think about it for a second. Another dimension? A rip in reality? More like a soft tear.

Anyway, what else were they capable of... you had never felt anything like what you felt from the keyboard.

Even now, with it sitting right next to you, you dared not to touch a key. You feared the power it held over you.
